# Sentimental / Mario (More)

This Python program is an implementation to [CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science Week 6 - Sentimental / Mario (More) Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/6/mario/more/). This Python program generates a double half-pyramid of a specified height using hash symbols (#). The program prompts the user to provide the height of the pyramids and then generates the double half-pyramids according to the user's input.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download the program files by running the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd "Sentimental / Mario (More)"
    ```

3. Run the program by executing the command `python mario.py`.

## Program Structure

- `mario.py`: The main Python program that prompts the user for the height of the double half-pyramids and generates the double half-pyramids using hash symbols.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `"Sentimental / Mario (More)"` directory.
2. Run the program using the command `python mario.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to input the desired height of the double half-pyramids.

## How the Program Works

1. The program uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input until a valid input is provided.
2. Inside the loop, the program attempts to convert the user's input to an integer using the `int` function.
3. If the conversion is successful and the input is within the range of 1 to 8 (inclusive), the program enters a nested loop to generate the double half-pyramids.
4. The nested loop uses the `print` function to display spaces and hash symbols, creating the pattern of the double half-pyramids.
5. The number of spaces and hash symbols printed in each line is determined by the current value of the loop variables.
6. The two pyramids are separated by two spaces and aligned to the bottom-left corner of the terminal window.
7. If the user's input is not valid (not a positive integer between 1 and 8), the program continues to prompt the user for input.

## Testing

You can test the program by running it and providing different height values as input. For example:

```bash
$ python mario.py
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```

## Additional Notes

- The program uses a `try` and `except` block to handle cases where the user's input cannot be converted to an integer (ValueError).
- The program ensures that the height input is within a valid range (1 to 8) before generating the double half-pyramids.
- The program uses the `print` function to display spaces and hash symbols. The number of spaces and hash symbols in each line is determined by the loop variables.
- The double half-pyramids are separated by two spaces and aligned to the bottom-left corner of the terminal.
- Feel free to experiment with the program by adjusting the range of valid heights or customizing the symbols used to build the double half-pyramids.

Remember that this program is a simple example to demonstrate user input, loops, and output formatting in Python. It's a starting point to learn about these concepts in programming.
