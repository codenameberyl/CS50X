If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize
their audio aura?

To characterize the listeners audio aura, here is what my query looks like and the result below:

SELECT AVG(energy) , AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) from songs;

+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

The result was 0.71646 in AVG(danceability), 0.65906 in AVG(energy), and 0.484443 in AVG(valence).
So I think the listeners audio aura has an energetic dancing rythme.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this
aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

It would be better to calculate the listeners audio aura every month because of the type of music released
and the listeners mood.
