# Homepage

This Python program is an implementation to [CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science Week 8 - Homepage Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/8/homepage/). This guide will walk you through creating a simple homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The homepage will introduce yourself and include various interactive elements to enhance user experience.

## Getting Started

1. Log into cs50.dev and open the terminal.
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory using the `cd` command.

## Testing

1. Run an HTTP server in the terminal to serve your webpage:

   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

   If you don't have the `http-server` package installed, you can install it using `npm install -g http-server`.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal.

3. Test the navigation links, button interactivity, and responsive design.
