# Lab 8: Trivia

This Python program is an implementation to [CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science Week 8 - Lab 8: Trivia](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/8/). This is a guide on how to implement a trivia webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage will allow users to answer multiple-choice and free-response trivia questions and provide feedback on their answers.

## Getting Started

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2. Click inside your terminal window, then execute `cd` by itself to navigate to the appropriate directory.

## Testing

1. Run an HTTP server in the terminal to serve your webpage:

   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

   If you don't have the `http-server` package installed, you can install it using `npm install -g http-server`.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal.

3. Test the trivia questions by clicking on choices and confirming free-response answers.
